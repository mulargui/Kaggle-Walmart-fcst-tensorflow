Kaggle-Walmart-fcst-tensorflow
==============================
Reimplementation of Kaggle's Walmart sales forecast challenge using TensorFlow, Keras and NN.

Previous implementations:\
https://github.com/mulargui/Kaggle---Walmart-forecast-challenge \
https://github.com/mulargui/Kaggle-Walmart-fcst-in-Spark

Directories:\
docker. how to create and manage the container. Extended tensorflow container adding additional libraries\
k8s. templates to create the service in kubernetes. tested with minikube. Edit setup.bat to point to the directory where you cloned the repo\
kaggle. all the info related to the challenge\
src. Source code of the solution and other files I used to explore several aspects of the data\
data. samples of data (.csv) generated by the different src files

You can see how I set up minikube in the repo http://github.com/mulargui/healthylinkx-k8s 

Note: Keep in mind if you clone this repo in Windows that shellscripts' line breaks will be adjusted to Windows and will not work in minikube. You will need to edit the files.
